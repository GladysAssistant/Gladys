   * Node.js (and consequently Sails.js) apps scale horizontally. It's a      *
   * powerful, efficient approach, but it involves a tiny bit of planning. At *
   * scale, you'll want to be able to copy your app onto multiple Sails.js    *
   * servers and throw them behind a load balancer.                           *
   *                                                                          *
   * One of the big challenges of scaling an application is that these sorts  *
   * of clustered deployments cannot share memory, since they are on          *
   * physically different machines. On top of that, there is no guarantee     *
   * that a user will "stick" with the same server between requests (whether  *
   * HTTP or sockets), since the load balancer will route each request to the *
   * Sails server with the most available resources. However that means that  *
   * all room/pubsub/socket processing and shared memory has to be offloaded  *
   * to a shared, remote messaging queue (usually Redis)                      *
   *                                                                          *
   * Luckily, Socket.io (and consequently Sails.js) apps support Redis for    *
   * sockets by default. To enable a remote redis pubsub server, uncomment    *
   * the config below.                                                        *
   *                                                                          *
   * Worth mentioning is that, if `adapter` config is `redis`, but host/port  *
   * is left unset, Sails will try to connect to redis running on localhost   *
   * via port 6379                                                            *
   *                                                                          *

   * Global authorization for Socket.IO access, this is called when the       *
   * initial handshake is performed with the server.                          *
   *                                                                          *
   * By default (`authorization: false`), when a socket tries to connect,     *
   * Sails allows it, every time. If no valid cookie was sent, a temporary    *
   * session will be created for the connecting socket.                       *
   *                                                                          *
   * If `authorization: true`, before allowing a connection, Sails verifies   *
   * that a valid cookie was sent with the upgrade request. If the cookie     *
   * doesn't match any known user session, a new user session is created for  *
   * it. (In most cases, the user would already have a cookie since they      *
   * loaded the socket.io client and the initial HTML page.)                  *
   *                                                                          *
   * However, in the case of cross-domain requests, it is possible to receive *
   * a connection upgrade request WITHOUT A COOKIE (for certain transports)   *
   * In this case, there is no way to keep track of the requesting user       *
   * between requests, since there is no identifying information to link      *
   * him/her with a session. The sails.io.js client solves this by connecting *
   * to a CORS endpoint first to get a 3rd party cookie (fortunately this     *
   * works, even in Safari), then opening the connection.                     *
   *                                                                          *
   * You can also pass along a ?cookie query parameter to the upgrade url,    *
   * which Sails will use in the absense of a proper cookie e.g. (when        *
   * connection from the client):                                             *
   * io.connect('http://localhost:1337?cookie=smokeybear')                    *
   *                                                                          *
   * (Un)fortunately, the user's cookie is (should!) not accessible in        *
   * client-side js. Using HTTP-only cookies is crucial for your app's        *
   * security. Primarily because of this situation, as well as a handful of   *
   * other advanced use cases, Sails allows you to override the authorization *
   * behavior with your own custom logic by specifying a function, e.g:       *
   *                                                                          *
   *    authorization: function authSocketConnectionAttempt(reqObj, cb) {     *
   *                                                                          *
   *        // Any data saved in `handshake` is available in subsequent       *
   *        requests from this as `req.socket.handshake.*`                    *
   *                                                                          *
   *        // to allow the connection, call `cb(null, true)`                 *
   *        // to prevent the connection, call `cb(null, false)`              *
   *        // to report an error, call `cb(err)`                             *
   *     }                                                                    *
