# Contributing to Gladys

We love your input! It's always great in open-source to receive help from other people ðŸ˜„

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Before making a Pull Request

Make sure you discussed with the team on [Gladys Community](https://community.gladysassistant.com/) to ensure your pull request goes in the same direction as current developements ðŸ™‚

Then, create a GitHub Issue to indicate that you're working on the topic.

As soon as you have code to show, create a draft PR so that your code is visible to the team so we can discuss the changes.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed the APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes. (`npm test`)
5. Make sure your code lints. (`npm run eslint`)
6. Make sure your code is pretty (`npm run prettier`)
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/gladysassistant/Gladys/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/gladysassistant/Gladys/issues); it's that easy!
